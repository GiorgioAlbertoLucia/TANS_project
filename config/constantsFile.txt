# This is a configuration file storing some parameters for the reconstruction of the primary vertex
#

noise:
    nPoints:    10      # maximum number of hits generated by the noise

recTolerance:
    deltaPhi:   0.01    # [rad] maximum angular difference between two points to be used in reconstruction
    zBinWidth:  0.5     # [cm]  bin width used to reconstruct z coordinate of the vertex
